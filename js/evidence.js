		<i>April 1st entry</i><br>
		April's Fool, I hung out with Alicia. Her mother, Ms. Patterson, who I not really comfortable with insisted me to join her family dinner next Friday. I wish I'm dead by then. But at that moment, I couldn't really turn her down, could I?<br>
		<br>
		<i>April 4rd </i><br>
		During the band practice, Alicia's older brother and one of his friend turned up. They were dicks. I guess her brother didn't like me around his sister. But why do I care?<br>
		<br>
		<i>April 6th </i><br>
		I'm not paranoid, or maybe I am. On my way home, I feel that somebody is watching me. Fuck, if I has to guess, it could be Alicia's dick brother.
